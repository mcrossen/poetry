# Poetry
Imitate poetry and other texts.

## Purpose
This is probably the first code ever written as part of a homework assignment
for a humanities class. I was assigned to make a creative project that imitates
a work or piece of art that we studied during the semester. My teacher indicated
that writing code to automate this project would also be acceptable.

## Instructions
To imitate a style of writing, simply pass a few plain text files to the
provided script. The script will then generate text with similar word structures
to the inputed files. This generated text will appear on stdout.
```
./imitate.rb samples/Coleridge-KublaKahn samples/Wordsworth-LinesAboveTintern
```
Using an entire directory as input is also acceptable.
```
./imitate.rb samples/
```

## Acknowledgements
The sample Romantic poetry was found
[here](http://www.online-literature.com/wordsworth/). It is the same poetry that
we studied for class.
